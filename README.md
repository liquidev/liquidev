  - Video editing. I have a bunch of YouTube channels.
    - [liquidex](https://www.youtube.com/@liquidexw) - programming, in Polish
    - [liquidex - Wyw√≥z ≈ömieci](https://www.youtube.com/@liquidexspzoo) - gaming and random trash, <!-- the channel name is literally "garbage disposal" --> also in Polish
    - [liquidev](https://www.youtube.com/@liquidev) - I guess you could call it the official channel for this GitHub profile but it kinda sucks in terms of the amount of content it has.
  - Video games. [This one](https://hatintime.com)'s my favorite.
    - Speedrunning's also cool.
