### Incomplete

Just so you don't think I'm some indestructible gigachad. The following projects are unusable, in a before-MVP stage, or totally abandoned.

- ü§ö **[Fizzerb](https://github.com/liquidev/fizzerb)** - Physically-based path traced reverb experiment. Barebones but works.
- üïó **[pod:renn](https://github.com/liquidev/podrenn)** - _Now this is podracing._ This was going to be a podracing game, but game design is hard.
- üïó **[VVVVVV](https://github.com/liquidev/VVVVVV)** - Port of VVVVVV to the PlayStation Portable. Barely playable, software rendered so suffers from low FPS. PSP SDK docs really didn't make this easy.
- ‚èπ **[tsuki](https://github.com/liquidev/tsuki)** - Programmer-oriented compiled programming language. Gave up on it because Rust already exists and suits my needs perfectly well. Compiler emits machine code but doesn't do anything interesting.
- ‚èπ **[hayago](https://github.com/liquidev/hayago)** - Statically-typed scripting language. ‚ÄúLike Nim, but with braces!‚Äù‚Ñ¢ This one has a long history and I eventually just got bored (both of this project and Nim.)
- ‚èπ **[Planet Overgamma](https://github.com/liquidev/planet-overgamma)** - A game about crashing on an unknown planet and using automation to survive and thrive. This one had so many rewrites it would make your head spin. I got bored of it.
- ...as well as tens of others I started and got bored of after ten minutes.

Legend:
- ü§ö **On hold**
- üïó **Maybe someday**
- ‚èπ **Abandoned**

## Other stuff

- Pronouns: he/him
- Links:
  - [Blog](https://liquidev.net), where I post longer-form thoughts, ideas, and tutorials from time to time.
  - [cohost](https://cohost.org/liquidev), which is where I post more random and less well thought out stuff.
  - [itch.io](https://liquidev.itch.io/), where you can find my games, though my profile do be kind of dead.
  - [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/daknus), where you can find bleep bloops I make from time to time.
- Interests:
  - [Music](https://listenbrainz.org/user/liquidev). Electronic, jazz, and maybe alt rock from time to time.
  - Video editing. I have a bunch of YouTube channels.
    - [liquidex](https://www.youtube.com/@liquidexw) - programming, in Polish
    - [liquidex - Wyw√≥z ≈ömieci](https://www.youtube.com/@liquidexspzoo) - gaming and random trash, <!-- the channel name is literally "garbage disposal" --> also in Polish
    - [liquidev](https://www.youtube.com/@liquidev) - I guess you could call it the official channel for this GitHub profile but it kinda sucks in terms of the amount of content it has.
  - Video games. [These](https://hatintime.com) [ones](https://deltarune.com/) are my favorites. You might even say I've developed an obsession over them.
- This portfolio mostly includes my own stuff and open source contributions. You may find I have contributed to other things, too. *\*disappears without elaborating\**
  - *...not really. You'll just have to scavenger hunt a little to find out.*
- If you wanna chat, you can contact me on:
  - Discord. My username's the same as my GitHub display name. I'm around on various Rust and non-Rust related servers if you need to ping me. And do say hi after friending me, because bots are annoying.
  - Matrix. Homeserver is gacko.pl, my username is my GitHub username but abbreviated (lqdev.)
  - Just beware I'm a pretty darn weird guy. And much more friendly than I seem here in this portfolio. *\*sends hugs\**
    - Y'know, with me being all serious in the previous paragraphs... it's a design thing. Get to the point quickly, then you can ramble.
      - Like yeah, I'm almost out of topics to discuss so I'm gonna ramble a bit to get over the word limit. How else am I gonna get an _A_?
    - I chose to limit the use of emojis here because I don't like how corporate and soulless the Unicode ones are; I tend to use meme emotes on Discord but a) I don't think I can have them on GitHub, and b) they don't really fit the format of this document. Like now that I've been using full sentences with capital letters and "I" instead of "i" to refer to myself, it would be weird to switch to my chat-style all lowercase filled with [huehs](http://hueh.ovh/) and [kots](https://liquidev.net/syf/kot.png) and stuff.
    - Why am I even typing out these bullet points? Oh I dunno. I'm slacking off. I'm supposed to be cleaning my room now but the loud vacuum cleaner noise irritates me, and also it's a really hot day today (not really - it's raining) and I have a Need for Sleep. Am I at the word limit yet?

<!-- hello there lurker! glad to see you.
     <del>i didn't put any easter eggs here yet, check back later.</del>
     in case you're reading this, stay tuned for Polaris, but keep this a secret. ‚ù§Ô∏è love from Poland -->
