# hiii!!!

my name is riki (or リキ萌), and I'm a cute little ragdoll who likes coding. = –w– =

if you wanna chat, you can find my contact details [here](https://riki.house/b?hello).

this GitHub profile has lots of existing projects, but I don't really work on them anymore—ongoing ones live [in my shed](https://src.liquidev.net).
this profile is mostly for open source contributions.

<sub>NOTE: my commit email is, well, exactly that. please do not use it to contact me, or your email will be ignored. thank you!</sub>
